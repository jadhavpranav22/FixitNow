# Complete Booking Flow Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document explains the complete booking flow implementation where customers can book services, contractors can view and accept/reject bookings, and customers receive real-time confirmations.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Backend Components
- **Booking Entity**: Stores booking information with status tracking
- **BookingService**: Handles business logic for booking operations
- **BookingController**: REST API endpoints for booking management
- **BookingRepo**: Database operations for bookings

### Frontend Components
- **BookingForm**: Customer interface for creating bookings
- **ContractorDashboard**: Contractor interface for managing bookings
- **CustomerDashboard**: Customer interface for viewing booking status

## üìã Booking Flow Steps

### 1. Customer Creates Booking
```
Customer ‚Üí BookingForm ‚Üí POST /bookings ‚Üí BookingService.createBooking()
```

**Process:**
- Customer fills out booking form with:
  - Service selection
  - Address
  - Scheduled date
  - Additional notes
- System creates booking with `PENDING` status
- Booking becomes visible to all contractors

**API Endpoint:**
```http
POST /bookings?customerId={id}&serviceId={id}&subServiceId={id}
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
  "address": "123 Main St, City, State",
  "scheduledDate": "2024-02-15",
  "notes": "Urgent repair needed"
}
```

### 2. Contractors View Available Bookings
```
Contractor ‚Üí ContractorDashboard ‚Üí GET /bookings/contractor/{id} ‚Üí BookingService.getBookingsByContractor()
```

**Process:**
- Contractor dashboard shows all `PENDING` bookings
- Each booking displays:
  - Service details
  - Customer information
  - Address and scheduled date
  - Notes
  - Accept/Reject buttons

**API Endpoint:**
```http
GET /bookings/contractor/{contractorId}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### 3. Contractor Accepts/Rejects Booking
```
Contractor ‚Üí Accept/Reject Button ‚Üí PUT /bookings/{id}/accept|reject ‚Üí BookingService.contractorAccept()|contractorReject()
```

**Process:**
- Contractor clicks Accept/Reject button
- System updates booking status:
  - Accept: `PENDING` ‚Üí `ACCEPTED_BY_CONTRACTOR`
  - Reject: `PENDING` ‚Üí `REJECTED_BY_CONTRACTOR`
- Contractor is assigned to accepted bookings

**API Endpoints:**
```http
PUT /bookings/{bookingId}/accept?contractorId={contractorId}
PUT /bookings/{bookingId}/reject?contractorId={contractorId}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### 4. Customer Receives Confirmation
```
Customer ‚Üí CustomerDashboard ‚Üí GET /bookings/customer/{id} ‚Üí Real-time updates
```

**Process:**
- Customer dashboard polls for updates every 30 seconds
- Status changes trigger notifications
- Accepted bookings show contractor contact information
- Rejected bookings remain available for other contractors

**API Endpoint:**
```http
GET /bookings/customer/{customerId}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### 5. Contractor Completes Work
```
Contractor ‚Üí Mark Complete ‚Üí PUT /bookings/{id}/confirm ‚Üí BookingService.confirmBooking()
```

**Process:**
- Contractor marks accepted booking as completed
- Status changes: `ACCEPTED_BY_CONTRACTOR` ‚Üí `COMPLETED`
- Customer receives completion notification

**API Endpoint:**
```http
PUT /bookings/{bookingId}/confirm
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Booking Entity
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "booking")
public class Booking {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    private String address;
    private String notes;
    private LocalDate scheduledDate;
    
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private BookingStatus status;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "contractor_id")
    private Contractor contractor;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "customer_id")
    private Customer customer;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "service_id")
    private Services service;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "subservice_id")
    private SubServices subservice;
}
```

### Booking Status Enum
```java
public enum BookingStatus {
    PENDING,                    // Visible to all contractors
    PENDING_ADMIN_APPROVAL,     // For admin review
    ASSIGNED_TO_CONTRACTOR,     // Admin assigned
    ACCEPTED_BY_CONTRACTOR,     // Contractor accepted
    REJECTED_BY_CONTRACTOR,     // Contractor rejected
    COMPLETED                   // Work finished
}
```
